          My journey began with a deep appreciation for aesthetics, leading me
          to study Product Design at 'Shenkar College of Engineering and
          Design'. This background has given me a keen eye for detail and a
          solid foundation in creating user-friendly designs.

          As my fascination with user experience grew through my transition from
          physical to digital products, it naturally led me to pursue a career
          in full-stack development. In 2024, I graduated from Epicodus,
          specializing in React and C#. My technical arsenal includes HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Node.js, ASP.NET, MySQL, Firebase, and more.

          I thrive on challenges and am always looking for new opportunities to
          learning.
